        <t>Before proceeding into deployment recommendations, it is important to first explore a few key concepts 
        about low latency networking. This is critical because in the past many networks have thought of only 
        bandwidth and/or priority at the sole network attributes that could be adjusted in order to improve 
        application or network quality. The advent of low latency networking forces a re-examination of those 
        old assumptions, as we take into account the profound impact that latency and jitter have on the quality of 
        the end user experience.</t>

       <section title="Real-Time Reporting"> 

        <t>Determine whether your application needs "sparse" flows or "congestion-controlled" (higher capacity) 
        flows. Sparse flows that are latency senstive should be marked as NQB (thus DSCP-45). This may be things 
        like DNS queries or VoIP media flows, where maximizing the bandwidth of the flow is not necesary.</t>

		    <t>Any application provider should be able to mark their traffic for the low latency queue, with no restrictions 
		    other than standards compliance or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines. This 
		    maintains the loose cross-layer coupling that is a key tenet of the Internet's architecture by eliminating 
		   the need for application providers and networks to coordinate and creates an environment of so-called "permissionless innovation".</t>
