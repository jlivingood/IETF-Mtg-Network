	    <section title="Introduction">
			    
		<t>IETF participants need a highly reliable and responsive network, with sufficient bandwidtht to avoid congestion, that enables work 
		      to be conducted without interuption or network limitation during an IETF meeting. Such a network enables in-person network attendees 
		      to get their work done. It also enables remote participants to have a good experience as well, via remote 
		      participation in working group meetings. This document makes recommendations about how to reduce complexity, reduce cost, and 
		      increase reliability of the IETF meeting network.</t>

		<t>In the past, approaches to revise network requirements started from the point at which the IETF currently operates. This risks 
		burdening such an exercise with old assumptions and requirements. This analysis, in contrast, is an idealized redesign that asks "if we were 
		building the IETF network from scratch today, what should it look like?".</t>
	    </section>
	
	    
	    <section title="Key Requirements">
		<t>
			<ol type="REQ%d:" group="reqs">
  				<li>Highly reliable and performant network with no experiments to potentially cause disruptions.</li>
  				<li>Support for network experiments via a separate Hackathon network.</li>
				<li>Redundant upstream connectivity to the internet.</li>
				<li>Native dual stack for all devices on the network - IPv4 and IPv6.</li>
				<li>Support for the most-recent IEEE Wi-Fi standard with ubiquitous Wi-Fi available in the meeting venue.</li>
				<li>Public ticketing system to report issues, as well as track/report status or closure.</li>
				<li>Public network performance dashboard and associated reports.</li>
			</ol>
		</t>

		</section>
		
	<section title="Network Experiments">
		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Network experiments MUST only occur on the Hackathon Network, which is a separate network form the Meeting Network.</li>
				<li>The Hackathon Network will run for the entirety of the IETF meeting, not just during the Hackathon.</li>
				<li>Participants may use a public ticketing system (with support for up-voting to support prioritization) to request 
					support for experimental new protocols or other experiments.</li>
			</ul>
		</t>
			
        </section>
	    
	    <section title="Extension of IETF Network to Hotels">

		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Hotel networks are now sufficiently performant that this is no longer an issue.</li>
				<li>If there are potential issues with filtering, participants can use a VPN (as most do anyway).</li>
				<li>The IETF meeting network MUST NOT be extended to hotels any longer.</li>
			</ul>
		</t>
	    

	    	</section>
	    

        <section title="Wireless SSIDs">
 		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>There shall be only one SSID for the Meeting Network: IETF</li>
				<li>There shall be only one SSID for Network Experiments (unless a special SSID is required as part of an experiment): IETF-Hackathon</li>
				<li>The wireless network shall require authentication</li>
			</ul>
		</t>
  
        </section>

       <section title="Real-Time Reporting"> 

		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>All data concerning the performance of the network should be made available transparently for all participants to see.</li>
				<li>The Network Operations Center (NOC) shall provide a real-time or near-real-time dashboard of all key network statistics</li>
				<li>Reporting using IPFIX (NetFlow) that shows the source/destination of network flows</li>
				<li>Bandwidth tracking of peak usage</li>
				<li>Transport protocol tracking (e.g., volume of TCP, UDP, QUIC)</li>
				<li>Application protocol tracking (e.g., volume of SMTP, HTTP, etc.)</li>
				<li>DSCP mark tracking (e.g., volume by DSCP code point)</li>
				<li>ECN tracking (e.g., volume with no ECN, ECT(1), CE)</li>
				<li>All aspects of Wi-Fi performance (e.g., by room, specific AP, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
		</t>
        </section>

	    <section title="Post-Meeting Reporting">
		    
		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Within 1 week of the shut down of the network a final network performance and incident(s) report 
					shall be sent to the community and posted on the IETF website.</li>
			</ul>
		</t>

	    </section>
	    
	    
	    <section title="Geo-IP Data"> 
		<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Shall be updated to the IETF meeting location within 1 week of the end of the prior IETF meeting, 
					so that Geo-IP databases pick up the change of geography well before the next IETF meeting.</li>
			</ul>
		</t>        
	    </section>

            </section>

        <section title="Cost Management">
				<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Total meeting network cost in 2024 was roughly $850,000. At 1,000 attendees per meeting and 3 meetings per year, 
					851,000/3,000 = $283 per participant for each meeting. If this cost was reduced, it could enable a material 
					reduction in meeting registration fees.</li>
				<li>A key activity is to have an independent team study these costs and make recommendations on how to reduce them.</li>
			</ul>
		</t>
	</section>
        
        <section title="Clarity on Roles and Responsibilities">
				<t>
			<ul>
				<li>Lines of reporting may need to be clarified.</li>
				<li>The NOC Lead contractor is responsible to regularly report to the IESG and IETF LLC concerning 
					meeting network operations.</li>
				<li>The IESG shall establish an appropriate community oversight mechanism for the meeting network operations 
					function (e.g., via GEN Area).</li>
			</ul>
